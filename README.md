# UnfairGaps

> AI is replacing engineers. The safest career move? Find a boring niche that Big Tech will never touch. This tool finds those niches.

<!-- TODO: GIF demo here -->

## The Story

I spent 2 years building tools nobody wanted. Every time it was the same: I'd get excited about a "clever" idea, spend months building it, and discover that nobody cared enough to pay. I was solving annoyances, not real problems.

Then I had a realization: **stop brainstorming ideas. Start reading court filings.** If a company is paying a fine or settling a lawsuit, they aren't looking for a "nice-to-have" tool. They're looking for a tourniquet.

So I burned $5K in API credits and built AI pipelines that scan enforcement data automatically. I found things like:
- Solar installers losing **$12K per rejected warranty claim** because field techs forget to geotag photos
- E-commerce stores settling **4,000+ ADA lawsuits/year** at $20-50K each
- Apparel brands writing off **$1-3M/year** on returns from assembly defects

I posted the results on Reddit:
- [659 upvotes on r/Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qc0cwd/) - "I scraped 48,000 court filings to stop guessing business ideas"
- [237 comments on r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1qurbh2/) - people begged me to scan their industries
- [102 upvotes on r/Logistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/logistics/) - trucking pain analysis

One user took my research and is now building a company around a gap I found. The posts got over 1.5M views total.

I tried to turn this into a SaaS. But I kept feeling like I was doing something wrong - locking up a methodology that could help thousands of people find real businesses. If developers start scanning boring niches and building solutions, everyone wins. Society wins because broken processes get fixed. The developer wins because they build a real business. And I win because I stop carrying the guilt of hoarding this.

**So here's everything I built.** 4 pipelines, 17 prompts, a Python CLI, and AI agent skills. Free. MIT license. Take it, improve it, build a boring profitable business with it.

## Why This Matters Right Now

Every week another headline: "Google cuts 12K engineers." "Meta lays off entire ML team." "Startup replaces 60% of engineering with AI."

The standard advice is "build a side project." But build what?

The most profitable software businesses solve painfully boring problems for industries that never make TechCrunch:
- Plumbing contractors paying **$50K/year in OSHA fines**
- Solar installers losing **$12K per rejected warranty claim** because a field tech forgot to geotag a photo
- Restaurant owners settling **ADA lawsuits for $20-50K** each

AI can't replace you if your customers are plumbing contractors who barely use email. **The boring niches are where the money is.** This tool finds them.

## The 5 Pipelines

| Pipeline | Input | Output | Use case |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Industry Scan** | Industry + Country | Pain points + business opportunities | "What problems exist in construction in Germany?" |
| **Idea Validator** | Business idea + Country | Verdict: VALIDATED / WEAK / NO_EVIDENCE / SATURATED | "Does my SaaS idea have real pain behind it?" |
| **Site Pain Audit** | URL | Claims vs reality report | "Is this competitor solving real problems or selling vitamins?" |
| **Customer Pain Finder** | URL | Your customers' documented pain points | "What are my customers actually losing money on?" |
| **Profession Scan** | Profession + Country (e.g. "lawyers in US", "Steuerberater in DE", "адвокат in KZ") | 8-15 pains with AI skill specs (calculator / checklist / template / reference / advisor) | "What AI tools should I build for accountants? What does a Rechtsanwalt spend hours on every week?" |

**Bonus: the repo ships with a US profession dataset.** 130 SCOPE profiles + 25 ready-made pain bundles in `data/professions/us/`. Clone and grep - no API calls needed to start. Other countries: not yet pre-generated, but the operation works for any country - run it and PR the result.

## Live example - Auto Detailers (US)

To make this concrete: one run of `profession-scan auto detailers in US` produced [13 specific pains](data/professions/us/pains/us-auto-detailers.json), each paired with a structured `skill_spec` (a buildable AI tool). Total money-at-risk if unmanaged: ~$158,000/yr per operator. 81 hours/week of work that AI could automate. All 5 skill types used.

Top three:

1. **Detail Job Price Calculator** (calculator). Most detailers eyeball pricing and undercut by 25%. The spec includes 10 inputs (vehicle_type, services, hourly_target_rate, monthly_overhead, miles_to_job, ...), the cost-plus formula with the 2026 IRS mileage rate ($0.67/mile) and 15.3% SE tax buffer, and outputs minimum + recommended price plus tax set-aside. Ship this as a $19/mo SaaS.
2. **EPA Stormwater Compliance Checklist** (checklist, $64,618/day at risk). Clean Water Act civil penalties for runoff into storm drains. The spec is a 12-step procedure with warnings ("biodegradable soap is NOT a defense") and citations (33 USC 1311, 40 CFR 122.26, EPA 2026 MSGP).
3. **California Car Wash Act Compliance** (checklist, $36,500/yr at risk). $300/yr registration + $15K surety bond + AB 5 worker classification ($25K+/worker penalty for misclassification). 11-step compliance walkthrough with statutory references (Labor Code §§ 2050-2067).

None of these are "lawyers experience burnout" platitudes. Each is a focused AI tool with input/output schema, formulas, and statute citations.

## The Philosophy

**Annoyances vs Liabilities.**

Most "market research" finds annoyances. UnfairGaps finds liabilities - places where businesses are **legally required** to lose money. If a company is paying a fine or settling a lawsuit, they aren't looking for a nice-to-have tool. They're looking for a tourniquet.

## How It Works

There are two architectures depending on the pipeline:

### Event-collection pipelines (industry-scan, validate-idea, site-audit, customer-pains)

These find pains from court filings + enforcement events. 4-phase protocol:

1. **Compose targeted search queries** - Claude determines the right regulatory agencies, court systems, and search language for your country
2. **Search the web** - finds lawsuits, fines, enforcement actions, industry reports
3. **Extract evidence** - structured findings: who, what, how much, source URL
4. **Analyze & report** - clustering, deduplication, scoring, opportunity generation

Use these when the source of pain is "someone paid for breaking the rules."

### profession-scan - two-stage architecture

Professional pain doesn't live in court filings. It lives in regulation + daily routine. Different problem, different solution:

**Stage 1 - Web search for regulatory facts (NOT for pains).**

7 targeted WebSearch queries pull facts from `.gov` / `law.cornell.edu` / BLS / professional associations:
- `daily_reality` - hourly workday, documents, deadlines, seasonality
- `regulatory` - statutes, licensing bodies, penalty amounts
- `tools` - software, gov portals, what's broken
- `terminology` - jargon, abbreviations
- `career_psychology` - levels, fears, burnout
- `community` - subreddits, associations, conferences
- `market` - salary, headcount, trends

Output: a single JSON profile with ~30 specific facts + source URLs. Web search is asked for **facts**, not insights.

**Stage 2 - Claude Opus 4.7 deduces the pains (no web search at this stage).**

The model reads the regulatory profile and figures out which specific recurring task is painful given that combination of documents, deadlines, penalties, and tools - and what AI skill would obliterate it. Output: 8-15 pains with structured `skill_spec` (calculator inputs + formula, or checklist steps + warnings, or template variables, or reference lookup keys, or advisor decision criteria).

Why split it. Web search gives facts but no insight. LLM alone gives insight but no facts. Stack them in order with structured handoffs (JSON, not free text), and you get output quality neither could produce alone: fact-grounded pains that read like a senior consultant wrote them.

All prompts are in `prompts/` - fully transparent, fully customizable.

## Quick Start - two ways to run it

There are **two equivalent modes**. Pick one. You can mix them per-task.

### Option A - Run it in Claude Code / Cursor / Codex for free (no API key)

If you use any agent that supports the [skills.sh ecosystem](https://skills.sh) (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, VSCode, Cline, and others), install with one command:

```bash
npx skills add AyanbekDos/unfairgaps-os
```

That installs one skill - `unfairgaps` - which bundles all five operations of the methodology. Call them in any agent session:

```
/unfairgaps industry-scan construction in US
/unfairgaps validate-idea "SaaS for warehouse ergonomic compliance" in US
/unfairgaps site-audit https://competitor.com
/unfairgaps customer-pains https://my-saas.com
/unfairgaps profession-scan lawyers in US
```

The first four operations share the same 4-phase unfairgap-detection protocol (research plan -> candidate pool -> evidence ledger -> unfairgap pattern synthesis -> report). Only the input and the final-report shape differ per operation.

`profession-scan` uses a different 3-phase protocol (SCOPE builder -> pain generator -> bundle formatter) because professional pains live in regulation + daily routine, not in court filings. It's native-only (no Perplexity / no API key) and country-aware (auto-localizes regulators, statutory citation format, language, and currency for any country).

No Perplexity API key, no Python environment, no config. The skill uses your agent's built-in `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` tools.

**Prefer a manual install?** Clone the repo and copy the skill folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyanbekDos/unfairgaps-os.git
cp -r unfairgaps-os/skills/unfairgaps ~/.claude/skills/
```

Claude Code runs the 4-phase protocol (research plan → candidate pool → evidence ledger with compressed cards → unfairgap pattern detection → final report). Output lands in your current working directory as `report-*.md` with a full run manifest for reproducibility.

This is the recommended path for single-run analysis, iteration, and anyone who doesn't want to manage API keys.

### Option B - Run it via CLI with a Perplexity API key (for automation / batch)

If you want to script it, run it in CI, or run overnight batches, use the CLI path. It's the same 4 pipelines, same output schema - just deterministic and non-interactive.

Requirements:
- Python 3.10+
- A Perplexity API key. Perplexity gives **$5/month free API credits** to every account (~20 full pipeline runs, no credit card needed). Get one at [perplexity.ai/settings/api](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api).

Install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyanbekDos/unfairgaps-os.git
cd unfairgaps-os
pip install scrapling httpx
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
```

When the skill files from Option A detect `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` in the environment, they automatically delegate to the CLI - so you can still invoke via `/unfairgaps-industry-scan` in Claude Code and it will take the faster CLI path.

### Run

```bash
# Find pain points in an industry
python run.py industry-scan --industry "construction" --country US

# Validate a business idea
python run.py validate-idea --idea "SaaS for restaurant health code compliance" --country US

# Audit a website's pain claims
python run.py site-audit --url "https://example.com"

# Find your customers' pain points
python run.py customer-pains --url "https://your-site.com"
```

### AI Agent support

Native skill flow works in any agent on the [skills.sh ecosystem](https://skills.sh) - Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, VSCode, Cline, and others. Install via `npx skills add AyanbekDos/unfairgaps-os` (see Option A).

Agents outside the skills.sh ecosystem: copy-paste the `SKILL.md` content into your agent and run the 4-phase protocol manually. Results depend on the agent's WebSearch/WebFetch support.

No AI agent at all: copy-paste the prompts from `prompts/` into ChatGPT or Claude.ai. Works, just more manual.

### Use prompts manually

Every prompt is in `prompts/` as plain markdown. Copy-paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or any LLM:

1. Open the pipeline folder (e.g., `prompts/industry-scan/`)
2. Follow steps 01, 02, 03... in order
3. Feed output of each step as input to the next

No code required. Works with any LLM that can search the web.

## Country Support

**All 5 pipelines work worldwide.** When you specify a country, Claude automatically determines:

- Regulatory agencies (OSHA in US, BG BAU + Finanzamt in Germany, HMRC + HSE in UK, КГД + Минтруда in Kazakhstan, URSSAF + DGFiP in France...)
- Court systems and legal databases
- Statutory citation format (USC/CFR, BGB/StGB, НК РК, Code général des impôts...)
- Search language (native + English fallback)
- Local currency (with USD conversion for cross-country comparison)
- Industry-specific and profession-specific regulations

Tested with: US, DE, KZ, RU, UK, BR, IN, AU, FR, and more. Quality is highest for countries with strong online regulatory presence and degrades gracefully (with explicit `coverage_gap` notes) for low-online-coverage countries.

## How is this different from ChatGPT?

| | ChatGPT / Claude | UnfairGaps |
|---|---|---|
| Source | "I think there might be problems..." | SEC filing #2024-03847, $2.3M fine |
| Evidence | Opinions and general knowledge | Court records, regulatory actions, documented losses |
| Structure | Free-form chat | 5 specialized pipelines with defined outputs |
| Verification | Trust the AI | Every finding has a source URL |
| Country-aware | Sometimes | Always - regulatory agencies, language, courts |

## Data Sources

UnfairGaps searches across:
- **Court records** - lawsuits, settlements, class actions
- **SEC EDGAR** - securities enforcement actions
- **EPA ECHO** - environmental violations and fines
- **OSHA** - workplace safety citations
- **CFPB** - consumer complaints (14M+ records)
- **openFDA** - product recalls and enforcement
- **Country-specific** - local regulatory databases based on your market

All public data. No scraping private databases. No paywalls.

## Cost

With Perplexity's free $5/month:
- ~4-5 full Industry Scans
- ~5-6 Idea Validations
- ~3-4 Site Audits
- ~2-3 Customer Pain Finder runs

One pipeline run costs roughly $0.50-1.50 depending on complexity.

## Help Wanted

I'm not a professional programmer. I built this because I needed it. Here's where I need help:

- **Direct database connectors** - Right now we search through Perplexity. Building direct connectors to PACER, SEC EDGAR, EPA ECHO, and OSHA databases would make results 10x more reliable and faster.
- **Prompt engineering** - The 20 prompts work, but they're not perfect. I'd love prompt engineers to tear them apart.
- **Python improvements** - The CLI runs but it's not elegant. Any Pythonista who wants to refactor - please do.
- **Country adapters** - Every country has its own regulatory databases. I know US and Kazakhstan well. Help me add yours.
- **Fill the profession dataset** - 130 US profiles are shipped, only 25 have pain bundles. Run `/unfairgaps profession-scan <slug> in US` on the others and PR the resulting JSON to `data/professions/us/pains/`.
- **Generate other-country datasets** - The `profession-scan` operation is country-aware. Pick a country, run `/unfairgaps profession-scan <profession> in <country>`, and PR the resulting profiles + pains to `data/professions/<cc>/`. UK, DE, FR, IN, BR, AU, NL especially welcome.
- **Bug reports** - Run it on your industry and tell me what breaks.
